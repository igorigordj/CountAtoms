# CountAtoms
Software that counts number of atoms in a molecule

Here is the problem: you are provided a molecular structure (a string) containing the symbols of chemical elements,
numbers and possibly parentheses. For example, NaCl, H2O or Ca(OH)2.

Given the string molecule, your task is to find how many atoms of each element are contained in the molecule. 
Return the result in the form [element1][amount1][element2][amount2]..., sorted alphabetically.
